# 🎅🏼AdventJS Calendar Project🎅🏼

Hobby project with various solutions to the <a href="https://adventjs.dev">AdventJS</a> 2023 challenges. Challenge for each day listed in individual files, and submitted on the AdventJS website. Contents were, unfortunately, updated a bit later than the actual challenge days due to limited availability to work on this. However, as wise people say — better late than never :)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change into the project directory: `cd advent-js`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.

## Usage

Run the solution for a specific day using the following command:

> `node day-1.js`

Replace `day-1.js` with the corresponding file for the challenge you want to solve. Inputs have to be added manually if running the code directly from your local terminal.
