# Advent of JS Project

Hobby project with various solutions to the Advent JS 2023 challenges. Challenge for each day is listed in individual files, before submitted on the webpage. Contents are, unfortunately, updated a bit later than the actual advent days due to limited availability to work on this. However, as wise people say—better late than never!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change into the project directory: `cd advent-of-js`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.

## Usage

Run the solution for a specific day using the following command:
> `node day-1.js`
Replace `day-1.js` with the corresponding file for the challenge you want to solve. Inputs have to be added manually if running the code directly from your local terminal.
